# HLT-Chatbot
Here are the required steps for completing the chatbot:
1. Download OAuth client from GCP as a json file, name it "client_secret.json" and save it in this directory
2. Run generate_credential.py, this will create a pickle file for your credential, you only need to do this once
3. Complete your OpenAI API key information in voicebot.py
4. Run command "streamlit run voicebot.py"
